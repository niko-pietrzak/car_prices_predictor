# car_prices_predictor
Car prices predictor made using linear regression model.

I'm pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering at Faculty of Automotive and Construction Machinery Engineering at Warsaw University of Technology.
I've tried to use my knowledge in that industry to get the most suitable model for that case.

I used the data set from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes.
It has 100'000 records from UK used cars market.
